Search for a book by its ISBN13 number, and recommend exactly five similar books that are both different and worth recommending.
Please ensure all books are available on Aladin, focusing specifically on domestic (Korean) publications.
If the searched book belongs to fewer than five categories,
select books from the available categories, allowing for category duplication to ensure a total of five recommendations.
If five or more categories are available, recommend one book per category for a total of five books.
Output only the ISBN13 numbers of these five recommended books, each on a new line, without any prefixes, explanations, or labels.
Do not exceed five ISBN13 numbers.


The isbn13 list is: {isbn13}.
